		<p>If you have read my resume, then it is clear to you that I can successfully juggle several responsibilities at once and integrate myself seamlessly into any organization I am placed in, regardless of the niche of personalities present. However, the diversity of my activities does not tell you who I am as a person.</p>

		<p>I had my first true personal marketing experience when I started the ambassador program at Southern Fried Cotton. At the time I knew many classmates who were representatives for various brands on campus, but I didn’t want to follow the same programs already laid out by the well-known companies. Instead, I wanted to start something new and fresh with a company that was still in its infancy.</p>

		<p>Southern Fried Cotton had just opened a store in Greenville and after a little bit of research I realized they did not have a student ambassador program. After e-mailing the owner I went into the store and gave a run-down on the benefits of having an ambassador program. The owner was convinced and thus the “SFC Broker” program was born. For the past two years I have distributed merchandise, guided students to the Greenville store, worked on commission, developed social media pages, helped develop several t-shirt designs, and polled students on their likes and dislikes that have contributed to much of what you see in SFC today. Since the inception of this program in 2012, online revenue has tripled and over 32 universities have ambassadors.</p>

		<p>I thrive best in creative environments where I am given full responsibility for tasks and free reign to complete them. During my internships at both Jeff Dezen Public Relations and WSPA/WYCW-TV, I was typically given a list of tasks to complete with free range to complete them by a certain deadline. I found that the more freedom I had the more I strived to exceed the expectations placed upon me.</p>

		<p>The news producers at WSPA/WYCW-TV would send me streams of photos and news stories that they would like to see on their website, Facebook and Twitter. I could arrange the information in any way that I wanted as long as a call to action was incorporated into the posts. I spent my internship using WSPA’s social media as a creative outlet to post news stories surrounding two of their networks: Your Carolina and Scene On 7. My days spent using social media at my internship rolled over into my personal life where I learned which posts and tweets would be of the most interest to my own friends and followers. I found it most interesting that when people listen to hard news, they want to know the unpleasant aspects of all corners of our world. Yet, when it comes to social media, people prefer to read feel good stories because the stories are more personal; they are your own.</p>

		<p>Social media has played a role in my internship at Jeff Dezen Public Relations, but as the name would suggest, I focused more heavily on the public relations side of things. Writing news releases, drafting pitches and blog posts, and organizing charts were all integral parts of the internship. I found that I flourished while working independently in high-pressure situations and proved that I could succeed through a hands-on approach. Throughout my internship I quickly adapted to the fast-paced environment and learned to prioritize important assignments while simultaneously completing other tasks. Additionally, I learned to have confidence in my ability to not only complete the task by the deadline, but also exceed expectations. </p>
